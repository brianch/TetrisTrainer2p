# Tetris Trainer 2P

An attempt to turn Greg's [Tetris Trainer](https://github.com/GregoryCannon/TetrisTrainer/) into a remote (p2p) 2-players NES Tetris clone. It's in it's early development but already functional, you can [try it in your browser here](https://brianch.github.io/TetrisTrainer2p/). just paste the opponent's ID into the textarea and click connect, after you two are connected, click Start (both need to click start, it currently doesn't simul start automatically).

Up to now I had better results when both parties were using chrome/chromium, but that also depends on the specific network you're in. If the movement appears faster than it should, try switching to a 60Hz monitor refresh rate if you're using a higher one.
