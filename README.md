# Tetris Trainer 2P

An attempt to turn Greg's [Tetris Trainer](https://github.com/GregoryCannon/TetrisTrainer/) into a remote (p2p) 2 players NES Tetris clone. It's in it's very very early development but you can [try it in your browser already](https://brianch.github.io/TetrisTrainer2p/), just copy the id to the textarea and click connect. Up to now I had better results when both parties were using chrome/chromium.
