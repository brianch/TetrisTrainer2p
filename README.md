# Tetris Trainer 2P

An attempt to turn Greg's [Tetris Trainer](https://github.com/GregoryCannon/TetrisTrainer/) into a remote (p2p) 2-players NES Tetris clone. It's in it's early development but already functional, you can [try it in your browser here](https://brianch.github.io/TetrisTrainer2p/). just paste the opponent's ID into the textarea and click connect, after you two are connected, click "Ready!".

It should work most of the time, but depending on your specific network connection (if you're using mobile internet for example), it can fail to connect, a workaround for this is to use a TURN server to make the connection possible (the small auth button is for this), if you're from the Classic Tetris community contact me on discord if you need to use this.

If the movement appears faster than it should, try switching to a 60Hz monitor refresh rate if you're using a higher one.
